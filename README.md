# Sorting-Algorithm-Simulator

ICS4UI 2020 Final Assignment. A visual representation of different types of sorting algorithms using playing cards.

Date Created: November 10, 2020

Description: This code visually models the behaviours of different sorting algorithms, specifically, bubble sort, insertion sort, 
selection sort and shell sort. In addition, the GUI allows for the user to change specific setting such as the type of sorting algorithm, 
background image, speed of the animation, and the number of cards. Finally, the GUI also allows the user to pause the animation at any given 
point as well as a reset button to draw a new set of cards. Made in Processing 3.5.4 with the G4P Library.

User Tips:
 1. The animation will run smoothest with the "No Background" option
 2. After changing any setting, the resume button will turn green and display "Start". Click this to run the animation with the new settings.
